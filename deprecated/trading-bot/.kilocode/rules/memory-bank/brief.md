Develop a dynamic, responsive web application for an AI trading bot platform. The platform should feature a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS) to manage all website content, including a dedicated marketing section. This marketing section must include detailed product information (product descriptions, benefits, pricing structures, customer testimonials, contact information, and a news feed). Implement a user registration system. Upon successful registration, users should gain access to a personalized dashboard. The dashboard should include a technical analysis page displaying real-time market evolution data, a performance page showcasing individual and aggregated results for the trading bots, and a configuration page allowing users to set up and customize their trading bots. Strive to create a realistic and intuitive setup process. Incorporate parallax scrolling effects throughout the website to enhance visual appeal and user engagement. Ensure the application is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across all devices, and include animated graphs to visualize market data and bot performance. Integrate links to relevant social media platforms. Finally, propose potential improvements and future enhancements to the platform's functionality and user experience.

The front end is already built but we have not a supporting backend. Create backend and connect to the frontend that we already have.
